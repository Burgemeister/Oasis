      <p>Oasis Thorne, '98</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="glitch">THE STORY</h2>
    <p>This is Oasis Thorne. Born on August 13, 1980, she lives with her mom. With pale skin, silver hair, and elf-like features, she's an outcast. Her room is her safe space—the smell of incense and impressive piles of books lit by candles make her cave a dark academia lover's dream. She mostly likes to read about witches and myths. A new song just came out—<strong>"Duvet" by Bôa</strong>—and it's on endless repeat.</p>

    <p>Her dad hasn't been in the picture since she was six. He just left. Without a word. It left a wound that made her feel like she was never enough. Not enough to stay for. When she started high school, history repeated itself; she didn't fit in. These wounds made her introverted and conflict-avoidant. Most days, she just feels like a nobody.</p>

    <p>Her only solace is a vibrant dream world where her father appears often. In those moments, she finally feels comforted, seen not just by her father, but even by her classmates. But the comfort is fleeting. The dreams begin to rot from the inside out. Familiar faces twist into masks of terror, and the nightmares start to bleed into her waking hours. As the surreal horrors manifest in the real world, Oasis must navigate a terrifying landscape of dream logic to uncover the truth of why her father left and, more importantly, to learn that her own worth isn't something to be found in a dream, but something to be built in reality.</p>
